### CS405 Project 3  
This repository is for project 3 of CS 405, where I worked on implementing a solar system simulation using WebGL, including hierarchical transformations, lighting effects, and scene graph concepts.

### Tasks  

#### Task 1: Scene Graph Hierarchy  
In this task, I:  
- Implemented the "draw" function to handle hierarchical transformations.  
- Ensured transformations applied to parent nodes propagated to their children.  

#### Task 2: Diffuse and Specular Lighting  
In this task, I:  
- Added diffuse lighting to make objects brighter when facing the light source.  
- Implemented specular lighting for shininess effects based on the light's reflection.  

#### Task 3: Adding Mars to the Solar System  
In this task, I:  
- Added Mars as a new node in the scene graph, making it a child of the Sun.  
- Applied transformations to position and scale Mars in the scene.  
- Made Mars rotate 1.5 times faster than the Sun around the Z-axis.
